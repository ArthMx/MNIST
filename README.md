# MNIST
The MNIST dataset contains 60000 pictures of handwritten digits in 28x28 pixels.

- In MNIST.ipynb, the first notebook, I define a few functions to plot visualize the digits. The function are also in the file MNISTFunctions.py
- In MNIST_2.ipynb, I do a quick comparaison of different classifier on the dataset (without doing any hyperparameters tuning).
- In MNIST_3.ipynb, I apply Principal Component Analysis to the dataset, to reduce the dimensionnality of the features. I also use PCA to visualize the data in 2 dimensions, I also use t-SNE with the same goal.
